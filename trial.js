// Conditional Statements //

//Declare the variable
var x = 7

if(x==7){
    console.log("X is Seven")
}
else{
    console.log("X is not Seven")
}

// To test for multiple conditons we use the keyword else if
//they all terminate with an else statement
var x=6
if(x==4){
    console.log("X is four")
}
else if(x==6){
    console.log("X is Six")
}
else{
    console.log("No condition was met!")
}

//Switch is another conditional stement for testing for multiple statement 
// **assignment** read on switches and write a program

//=== is not only used to test for values but to test for data types as well
